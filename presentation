        add_task(tasks, task_name, deadline)
        Adds a new task to the dictionary with its deadline and initial status as pending.

        view_tasks(tasks)
        Lists all tasks with their details and statuses.

        mark_task_complete(tasks, task_name)
        Marks the task as complete and compares the current time to the deadline. Provides feedback on whether the task was completed on time.

        delete_task(tasks, task_name)
        Deletes the specified task from the dictionary.

        view_overdue_tasks(tasks)
        Compares each task's deadline to the current date and identifies overdue tasks.

Example Scenarios

    Marking a Task as Complete:
        Input: "Task name: Buy groceries"
        Output:
            "Great job! Task 'Buy groceries' was completed before the deadline!"
            Or: "You've missed the deadline, try harder next time."
